              <p class="introduction">It's easy to get lost in the depths of our problems. Perhaps we're in a new ands unfamiliar place, academic obligations have bogged us down, or there's simply too much that dwells on our mind, making us feel suffocated and seemingly unable to escape what ails us. We can never fully escape life's problems, but we can certainly find healthy ways to deal with them.</p>

              <p class="introduction">This guide offers some simple techniques that may help you deal with your stress in more healthy and sustainable ways. It uses the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy">dialectical behaviour therapy</a>, a form of psychotherapy that has been successful in treating anxiety, depression, and difficulties in managing overwhelming feelings. You may therefore find these techniques helpful in developing mindfulness, improving your stress tolerance, and regulating your emotions, and consequently strengthening your relationships with others.</p>

              <p class="introduction"><i>Disclaimer: This guide should not be used as a substitute for professional advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please seek help from a qualified healthcare professional if you are experiencing significant distress or mental health concerns.</i></p>

              <h2 class="mantras mb-3">Mantras</h2>

              <p class="mantras">Mantras are phrases that can be used during stressful moments, with the effect that repeating them can be calming or serve as a reminder of some greater truth. Each mantra has a different purpose, and may relieve stress, anxiety, anger, or sadness. Choose one that fits and try saying it loud, as many times as necessary.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #73556B">

                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">This too shall pass.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #736770">Meaning behind this mantra: No matter how good or bad we feel, no feeling lasts forever. Appreciate when things are going well, but also remember when things <i>aren't</i> going well, that they will get better.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #735571">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">I shouldn’t spend today’s energy on the problems of tomorrow.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #736772">Meaning behind this mantra: Anxiety over the future can be crippling, making us worry about something that hasn't happened yet&mdash;or may never even happen. Instead, it might be worth remembering that tomorrow's problems should be left for tomorrow.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #6F5573">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">I can’t change what’s already happened.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #716773">Meaning behind this mantra: Radical acceptance means coming to terms with the past, accepting what has already happened so we can move on instead of dwelling on it. Thus, we can't change the past, but we can use what we've learned to improve our future.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #695573">
                <div class="card-body">

              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #6F6773">Meaning behind this mantra: No matter what you're dealing with right now, remember that you've overcome many struggles to get here. You can overcome this one, too. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">

                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #736771">Meaning behind this mantra: Pain is temporary, and you've survived many painful moments already. This is just another one.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #725573">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">My thoughts don’t control my life, I do.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #726773">Meaning behind this mantra: We all experience intrusive, negative thoughts, which prey on our anxieties and self-esteem. We can't always avoid such thoughts, but we can control our responses to them.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #6C5573">
                <div class="card-body">
                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">I can be anxious and still deal with the situation.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #706773">Meaning behind this mantra: Anxiety is a part of life, and it's OK to feel anxious or "not right" while still doing what we need to do.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #665573">
                <div class="card-body">

                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #6E6773">Meaning behind this mantra: We can't control other people's actions or change our past, so sometimes the best approach is just to say, "So what?" and focus on what we can do moving forward.</p>

              <h2 class="reminders my-3">Reminders</h2>

              <p class="reminders">These reminders are not mantras but useful things to remember. We have found them to be especially useful in helping college students cope with the social aspects of life on campus, and they may be helpful to you, too.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">Don't benchmark your happiness. Find your own path to being happy.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #696773">Everyone presents an idealised version of themself to the outside world, in order to project their success or happiness, or even as a defence mechanism against critism. This means that when we compare ourselves with another people, we're making comparisons with their idealised versions, ignoring the fact that, like us, they also have problems, insecurities, and worries that plague them. The healthiest thing we can do, therefore, is to avoid to benchmarking our happiness against someone else's&mdash;don't base our happiness on someone else's definition of it, don't compare our happiness with theirs, and instead find ways to be happy for our own sake.</p>

              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #555A73">

                </div>
              </div>

               <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #676973">It's normal to want to fit in. We see how our favourite celebrities dress, pay attention to the latest trends, and in academia, how our professors flaunt their achievements and talk grandiloquently about themselves. It inspires or intimidates, and even if we know it's silly to copy others, being part of the in-group is tempting. Unfortunately, fitting in can mean sacrificing our true selves, and in so doing remove what was interesting about us in the first place. At the same time, trends change; if we want to be part of the in-group forever, we will spend our lives contorting to other people's standards, until we end up irrelevant and out of touch because trends will always outpace us. At point, with our formative years long gone, it's too late for us to know our true selves. Being different is not only OK, being comfortable with yourself will save you from many headaches in life&mdash;in addition to just making you a more interesting individual.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="card border-0 rounded-0" style="background-color: #555573">

                  <h3 class="card-title text-center text-white my-5 pb-0 px-3">If life is suffering, happiness is merely the temporary alleviation of suffering.</h3>
                </div>
              </div>

              <p class="explainer mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #676773">Viewing happiness in the context of suffering may seem pessimistic, but it has helped me to appreciate the better moments in my life. Consider: what is the dopamine-chasing we do on our phones but an attempt to forget about our worries for a moment&mdash;to alleviate our suffering? Addictive substances or activities (including some social media) exploit the release of dopamine, and while it may be pleasureable in the short-term, we have to continually engage to feel something, either becoming addicted or feeling "empty" if we stop. It's not healthy, but more importantly, it's also not fulfilling, and understanding this can help us find activities that are both pleasureable and fulfilling.</p>

              </div>

              <p class="explainer everybody-has-problems mt-2 mb-4" style="color: #676B73">This reminder stems from my all-too-common experience of students apologising endlessly for mistakes (and making excuses for them) instead of thinking of what they can do next to fix it. While apologies can be meaningful, they can also feel empty, especially when delivered repeatedly. As humans, we tend the view the world as revolving around us, prioritising our own problems and forgetting that our colleagues and friends also have lives to live. A rule of thumb here is that <i>everyone is going through their own nonsense</i>, and sometimes injecting our own nonsense just ends up burdening them further. We have to be mindful of our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dumping">emotional dumping</a> and respectful of our friends' boundaries.</p>
