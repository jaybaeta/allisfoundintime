          <h4 class="mb-5" style="text-align: center;">A guide to creating a work with multiple CC-licensed sources</h4>

          <p>It is often the case that, even if are creating something new, we will make use of existing works to supplement or improve our own works. This can be the simple use of an image to improve the esthetics of an article, or even building a documentary film around archive footage and sounds recorded entirely by others. 
          But one obvious stumbling block here is that we have to expect that all works not in the public domain are protected by copyright and thus not suitable unless our usage falls under fair use (or fair dealing). Creative Commons licenses solve this problem by clearly stating what we can and can't do with a given work. The prevalence of these licenses consequently means we now have access to a myriad resources, all of which we can use without fear of violating copyright law.</p>

          <p>Nevertheless, because there are different CC licenses, it's possible for people to become confused when it comes to creating a work that incorporates multiple CC-licensed works, especially if these sources are licensed differently. Another issue is using works licensed with the ND (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">NoDerivatives</a>) clause. When is a usage permissable, and when does it count as derivative? This confusion results in creators avoiding ND-licensed works, or otherwise recklessly using them as though they were licensed differently.</p>

          <p>If you're one of these people, then read on! In this guide, we will look at some examples of what counts as a derivative work from multiple sources and what only counts as a collection of works. We will also discuss creating a work that is wholly made up of other works, and how to attribute it appropriately.</p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: 700; text-align: center">An adaptation and a collection</h2>

          <p>In CC licenses, NoDerivatives specifies that a reuser is not allowed to create an adaptation or modification of the work&mdash;in other words, to create a derivative work&mdash;unless it is for personal use and will not be shared. The term “adaptation” has different meanings in different countries, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-an-adaptation">depending on</a> their respective copyright laws.</p>

          In the case of <a href="https://id.wikisource.org/wiki/Undang-Undang_Republik_Indonesia_Nomor_28_Tahun_2014">Indonesia's copyright law</a>, for example, Article 40, Section 1.n  states that “<i>adaptation</i> means the transformation of a work into another form. For example, a book adapted into a film.” This is a relatively loose definition of an adaptation. Nevertheless, in general, a work can be considered an adaptation when it has gone through enough modification that the resulting modified work shows enough originality to itself be copyrightable. If a work is a mere combination of works from multiple sources, in full or partially, with the content unchanged in any way, then it is not an adaptation and does not count as a derivative work, even when it is presented in a different format or medium. This work is normally called a <i>collection</i>.</p>

              <p>An <i>adaptation</i> is created when you modify the content of a work or remix the (modified) content of multiple works.</p>

              <p>In such cases, you must attribute the original works and indicate what changes you made. CC licenses with the ND clause may not be used.</p>

              <p>Examples include translations, music videos, photoshopped images, and films based on books.</p>

          <h2 style="font-weight: 700; text-align: center">Putting theory into practice, featuring <i>Mimi and Eunice</i> </h2>
          

          <p>Understanding the difference between an adaptation and a collection should be simple enough now, but let's put this understanding into practice with some real-world examples. For this, we decided to borrow from Nina Paley’s satirical comic strip, <i>Mimi and Eunice</i>, which is licensed CC BY-SA.</p>

          <!-- 
          <p>To illustrate I picked five topically-related strips and combined them to create a comic called “Mimi and Eunice: Copyright and Lawyers”. These five strips are used as is, nothing is changed from the original content, and therefore does not constitute an adaptation. Because of that, the type of CC license used in the original work does not matter, even if it uses an ND license, as long as the author is credited appropriately and the comic is licensed under a compatible license (Figure 1).</p>

          

          <p>Now, I’d want to introduce Mimi and Eunice to a wider audience in Indonesia, and for that it needs to be translated into Indonesian. Translation of a work is a form of adaptation, and since I want to share the result publicly, I need to make sure that the original comic is not licensed under an ND license. “Mimi and Eunice” is licensed under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license, so it allows me to make modification. I translated the comic I created in Figure 1 into Indonesian, then made an appropriate attribution to the author and noted the modification I made to the comic (Figure 2).</p>

          

          <p>Figure 3 is another example of an adaptation based on Mimi and Eunice comic, this time through remix. I took a panel of a strip and remixed it with another image from………….. licensed with ……….. to create a wallpaper. Both images were modified (through…?). The attribution was made appropriately for both sources of works, and the wallpaper is licensed accordingly as CC BY-SA(?) (see how to choose a compatible license for your work here: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#if-i-create-a-collection-that-includes-a-work-offered-under-a-cc-license-which-licenses-may-i-choose-for-the-collection).</p> -->

PROPER ATTRIBUTION FOR COLLECTION AND ADAPTATION WORKS

Providing attribution for a collection or adaptation can be quite meticulous, but it is necessary to give the respective author of the original works a clear credit. The proper attribution follows the standard Title-Author-Source-License (TASL) method (https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution), with an additional note on the modification applied to the original work for an adaptation. In addition to the attribution to the original works, the collection and adaptation work are also given a compatible license.The example of a complete attribution can be found underneath Figure 1, 2, and 3. For the adaptation works, the attribution include a statement of the modification, in this case “an Indonesian translation of…(the original work)” (Figure 2) and …………… (Figure 3).
