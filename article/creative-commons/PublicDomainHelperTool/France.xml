			<text>Into which of the following categories does the examined item fall?</text>
			<information>Please note that a single item might be protected by multiple layers of rights. For example, a CD will often comprise four layers of rights: if it contains music, that may be covered by copyright; any lyrics accompanying the music may also qualify for copyright protection, while the performers (musicians and singers or any other performer) as well as the phonogram producer may be protected by related rights. Similarly, a book may consist of text and illustrations, both of which may be protected by copyright. If an illustration is a photograph of a painting, a third layer of protection may be added. The term of protection of all relevant rights should be examined in order to determine whether the item as a whole is in the Public Domain or not. Please make sure you correctly identify and apply the Public Domain Helper Tool to all subject matter that qualifies for protection.

To this end, please also keep in mind that in accordance with French law and for the purposes of this Public Domain Helper Tool:

•	A volume, part, instalment, issue or episode of a work is a whole independent work. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to each of these individually.

•	If more than one natural person has collaborated on the production of a work that work should be considered to be a work of joint authorship. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to the work as a whole, but not to the individual contributions. 

•	If a work is created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his/her direction and name and where the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, so that it becomes impossible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work, the work is a collective work. The Public Domain Helper Tool should be applied to the work as a whole, but not to the individual contributions. 

•	If a work incorporates a pre-existing work without the collaboration of the author of the latter (composite work), both the former and the latter are independent works to each of which the Public Domain Helper Tool should be independently applied.

•	Individual items included in an (original or unoriginal) database may be independently protected. In this case, the Public Domain Helper Tool should also be applied to each of these individually.

			<value>Unoriginal Database</value>
			<gotoNr>8</gotoNr>
			<information>Unoriginal databases are databases which show that there has been qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of their contents. By contrast, original databases should be considered to be databases which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation. For the purposes of this Tool, original databases should be considered to be literary or artistic works.</information>
