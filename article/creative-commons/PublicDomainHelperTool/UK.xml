			<text>Into which of the following
categories does the
examined item fall?</text>
			<information>Please note that a single item might be protected by multiple layers of rights. For example, a CD will often comprise four layers of rights: if it contains music, that may be covered by copyright; any lyrics accompanying the music may also qualify for copyright protection, while the performers (musicians and singers or any other performer) and the phonogram producer may enjoy rights as well. Similarly, a book may consist of text and illustrations, both of which may be protected by copyright. If an illustration is a photograph of a painting, a third layer of protection may be added. The term of protection of all relevant rights should be examined in order to determine whether the item as a whole is in the Public Domain or not. Please make sure you correctly identify and apply the Public Domain Helper Tool to all subject matter that qualifies for protection.

To this end, please also keep in mind that in accordance with UK law and for the purposes of this Public Domain Helper Tool:

•	A volume, part, instalment, issue or episode of a work should be considered to be a whole independent work. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to each of these individually.

•	If a work has been created through the collaboration of two or more authors and the contribution of each author is not distinct from that of the other author or authors, it is a work of joint authorship. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to the work as a whole, but not to the individual contributions.

•	Individual items included in an (original or unoriginal) database may be independently protected. In this case, the Public Domain Helper Tool should also be applied to each of these individually.

			<value>Literary or artistic work</value>
			<gotoNr>49</gotoNr>
			<information>In order to determine whether a work is a work of copyright or not, please consult the following list. Please keep in mind that this list is only intended to be indicative and should not be understood as being either exhaustive or binding. Subject matter which does not seem to comfortably fall into any of these categories may nonetheless be protected by copyright and subject matter which does fall into these categories may not qualify for protection, subject to the provisions of UK law. 

LITERARY OR ARTISTIC WORKS
	
•	LITERARY WORKS, such as texts of books, pamphlets, lectures, addresses, sermons, poems, computer programmes, etc.

•	ARTISTIC WORKS, such as works of drawing, painting, sculpture, engraving and lithography, sketches, sculptures, works of applied art, illustrations, original photographs, works expressed by a process analogous to photography, etc.

(c) in the case of unpublished works or of works first published in a country outside the Union, without simultaneous publication in a country of the Union, the country of the Union of which the author is a national, provided that:
