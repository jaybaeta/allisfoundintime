			<text>Into which of the following categories does the examined item fall?</text>
			<information>Please note that a single item might be protected by multiple layers of rights. For example, a CD will often comprise four layers of rights: if it contains music, that may be covered by copyright; any lyrics accompanying the music may also qualify for copyright protection, while the performers (musicians and singers or any other performer) as well as the phonogram producer may be protected by related rights. Similarly, a book may consist of text and illustrations, both of which may be protected by copyright. If an illustration is a photograph of a painting, a third layer of protection may be added. The term of protection of all relevant rights should be examined in order to determine whether the item as a whole is in the Public Domain or not. Please make sure you correctly identify and apply the Public Domain Helper Tool to all subject matter that qualifies for protection.

To this end, please also keep in mind that in accordance with Spanish law and for the purposes of this Public Domain Helper Tool:

•	A volume, part, instalment, issue or episode of a work should be considered to be a whole independent work. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to each of these individually;

•	If a work has been created through the collaboration of two or more persons resulting an inseparable unitary whole, it is a work of joint authorship. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to the work as a whole, but not to the individual contributions.

•	If a work is created on the on the initiative and under the direction of a person, whether natural person or legal entity, who edits it and publishes it under his name, and where it consists of the combination of contributions by various authors whose personal contributions are so integrated in the single, autonomous creation for which they have been made that it is not possible to ascribe to any one of them a separate right in the whole work so made, it is a collective work. The Public Domain Helper Tool should accordingly be applied to the work as a whole, but not to the individual contributions. 

•	If a work incorporates a pre-existing work without the collaboration of the author of the latter (composite work), both the former and the latter are independent works to each of which the Public Domain Helper Tool should be independently applied. 

•	If a work is a collection of the works of other people, such as an anthology, or of other elements or data, which by the selection or arrangement of its content constitute intellectual creations (collection), both the individual contributions to the collection (if copyright subsists in them) and the collection as a whole should each be considered to be independent works to which the Public Domain Helper Tool should be applied. 

•	Individual items included in an (original or unoriginal) database may be independently protected. In this case, the Public Domain Helper Tool should also be applied to each of these individually.
